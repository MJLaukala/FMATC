### Welcome to the home of FMATC. (This page is under development.)

### About
FMATC (Free Multi-track Audio Capture) is a program that allows the user to capture audio from their computer devices and saves it in a separate file. The user can select the destination of the files and which hotkey they wish to use.

The reason I decided to build this application is because I prefer the quality of fraps over DxTory but fraps doesn't allow for the recording of multiple streams. With FMATC, you can now record your videos with whatever video capture software you would like and can record your audio streams separately.

This software is currently in an early alpha stage.
